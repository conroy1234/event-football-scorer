port:8082
h2 console : http://localhost:8082/h2
Driver Class : org.h2.Driver
User Name : sa

JDBC URL : jdbc:h2:mem:football-score

get all api call :  http://localhost:8082/api/football/score
create one api call: http://localhost:8082/api/football/score
fine by team one : http://localhost:8082/api/football/score/teamName
find by team two : http://localhost:8082/api/football/score/-teamName
find by id : http://localhost:8082/api/football/score/id/id
update using http put : http://localhost:8082/api/football/score/id/1
